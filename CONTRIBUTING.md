# Contributing to cloud-itonami-isic-1075

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Prepared Meals and Dishes
Manufacturing Operations actor.

## Scope

This repository is a specialization of the cloud-itonami architecture for ISIC
1075 (manufacture of prepared meals and dishes). Contributions should:

1. Extend or correct the **Governor rules** (food-safety constraints)
2. Add **product types** or **jurisdictional requirements** to the facts registry
3. Improve **test coverage** for prepared-meal/ready-dish-specific scenarios
4. Clarify **documentation** and ADRs

## Prohibited Changes

Do **not**:

- Add direct cook-line/chill-freeze-line/packaging-line control (cook line,
  blast chiller/freezer, and packaging line remain exclusive to plant staff)
- Modify the Governor to allow LLM confidence to override food-safety hard holds
- Add JVM-only code (all source must be `.cljc` / portable)
- Change the AGPL-3.0-or-later license

## Process

1. Open an issue describing your proposed change
2. Link to the relevant ADR (ADR-2607150000 or later)
3. Submit a pull request against `main`
4. Ensure all tests pass: `clojure -M:test`
5. Run linter: `clojure -M:lint`

## Code Style

- Use `.cljc` for all source (no `.clj` or `.cljs` only)
- Follow Clojure conventions (kebab-case, docstrings on public fns)
- Governor rules must be pure, side-effect-free predicates
- Test all new facts and registry entries
